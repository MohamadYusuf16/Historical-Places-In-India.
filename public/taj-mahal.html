                                The Taj Mahal('Crown of the Palace'),is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the
                                right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631
                                by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628-1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
                                it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex,
                                which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. </p> 
    
                            <p>
                                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued 
                                on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed 
                                to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 
                                ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). 
                                The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects
                                 led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. Various types of symbolism have been
                                 employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.

                                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 
                                "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces 
                                of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture 
                                and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year
                                 and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000-2007) initiative.

                                The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz
                                 Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.
                                  Construction started in 1632,and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding
                                   buildings and garden were finished five years later.The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's 
                                   grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj 
                                   Mahal.

                            <h3>Architecture and design</h3>
    
                            <p>
                                The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic 
                                and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful 
                                Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor 
                                of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),
                                Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht
                                 (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj),
                                  and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily 
                                  constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious
                                   stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.
